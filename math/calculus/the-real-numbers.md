# The Real Numbers

In calculus, our main working space is the field of real numbers
$\mathbb{R}$, it is an ordered number field obtained as the completion
of $\mathbb{Q}$ with respect to the standard absolute value.

$$
\xymatrix{
& A \ar[r]^f \ar[d]_a & B \ar[r] \ar[d] & C \ar[r] \ar[d] & 0 \\\\
0 \ar[r] & X \ar[r] & Y \ar[r] & Z &
}
$$

## Completeness

If an absolute value satisfies the **stronger triangle inequality**
$$|x + y| \leq \max (|x|, |y|)$$ for all $x$ and $y$, then $|x|$ is
called an *ultrametric* or *non-Archimedean* absolute value, otherwise
an *Archimedean* absolute value. The standard Euclidean absolute value
is an Archimedean one and will impose the following Archimedean property
on $\mathbb{R}$,

<div class="theorem">
For every positive $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$, there exists an
$N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $nx > y$.
</div>


<div class="theorem">
The completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ in terms of that every Cauchy sequence converges could be reworded as

-   **Nested intervals theorem.** Let $\{ I_n \}$ be intervals nested by
    inclusions, i.e. $I_1 \supset I_2 \supset \cdots$, then there is one
    and only one point contains in $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n$.

Moreover, together with the Archimedean property of $\mathbb{R}$,

-   **Least upper bound property.** Any nonempty subset which is bounded
    above has a least upper bound in $X$. (Or **Dedekind completeness.**
    Every Dedekind cut is generated by a real number).

-   **Monotone convergence theorem.** Any bounded monotonic sequence
    converges.

-   **Heine-Borel theorem.** Any subset is closed and bounded iff it is
    compact.

-   **Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.** Any bounded sequence contains a
    convergent subsequence.

-   **The intermediate value theorem.** Let $f: [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$,
    if $f(a) \cdot f(b) < 0$, then $\exists c \in [a, b]$ such that
    $f(c) = 0$.
