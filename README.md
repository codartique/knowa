> The Knowledge Instrumentality Project 「知識補完計画」

Knowa, as inspired by the [Stacks project](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu) and [nLab](https://ncatlab.org), is a collection of notes on particular topics in Mathematics and Computer Science, The composition of this project aims to provide a more accessible (e.g., better structed and more cross-reference friendly) online knowledgebase, primarily, for private use.

The name "Knowledge Instrumentality Project" is taken from "人類補完計画" of the animation *Neon Gensis Evangelion*.
